## About

Passport-Next/Passport is [Express](http://expressjs.com/)-compatible authentication
middleware for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Passport's sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an
extensible set of plugins known as _strategies_.  Passport does not mount
routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and
allows application-level decisions to be made by the developer.  The API is
simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides
hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.


## Install

```
$ npm install @passport-next/passport
